## Introduction
Goal was to allow users to learn more about different cities by focusing primarily on the cityâ€™s location, landmarks, and attractions/businesses. I wanted to build a platform that made it easier to find all the essential information about a specific country before traveling there. Having the descriptions of several countries on one web platform makes it easier for travelers to compare different aspects of countries without having to use multiple web tabs. 

## Design - Three Models
### Cities
Allowing users to search for specific locations, such as cities or towns, to find information about them. In the future, users can enter a location name or browse through a list of popular destinations. The platform will provide details about each location and users can explore different aspects of a location, such as its attractions, hotels, restaurants, and other businesses, to plan their trip effectively.

### Attractions
Another one of our models are attractions, which are prominent and recognizable points of interest within a destination. Users can search for specific landmarks or browse through popular ones. Each landmark result will provide users with detailed information about the site, including its significance and location. Users can also find nearby businesses, restaurants, and attractions related to the landmark to enhance their travel experience.

### Reviews
I hope to offer an extensive database of accommodations and businesses across various categories, such as hotels, motels, apartments, and more. Users can search for specific attractions or browse through categories based on their interests. Each housing location or business listing will include comprehensive details, such as descriptions, photos, etc. Based on our database, users will be able to make informed decisions about which accommodations or businesses to visit during their trip.
